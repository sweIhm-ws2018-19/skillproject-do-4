# Alexa Skills Kit SDK Sample - Alexa Alibi
A [AWS Lambda](http://aws.amazon.com/lambda) function that represents a skill which generates alibi scenarioes for the Amazon Echo using the Alexa SDK.

This skill is started by calling "Alexa Alibi" and then gathers input parameters from the user, such as the timespan which the alibis are supposed to cover.

The user also has the option of providing information about their social environment, their official occupation, their common activities and location. In doing so, the skill is directed to filter possible alibis with regard to the specified details, thus improving the alibi's credibility.
