An [AWS Lambda](http://aws.amazon.com/lambda) function that represents a skill generating an alibi scenario for the Amazon Echo using the Alexa SDK.

To utilize this skill and receiving an Alibi the command "Alexa start Alibi" must be issued. 
Afterwards the user feeds the Amazon Echo with informations. Those input parameters consist of the day and timespan which the alibi is supposed to cover.

Additionally the user has the option of providing information about their social environment, official occupation, common activities and location. In doing so, the skill is directed to filter possible alibis with regard to the specified details, thus improving the alibi's credibility.
